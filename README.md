## Custom Table

A custom nested data table design created for bulk editing.
The option to have nested data, and select this data to make bulk changes did not appear in available react tables.

The three Primary fields are Product, Placement, and Generic.

A Product can have multiple Placements, and a Placement can have multiple Generics. You are able to select all, for either of these three, by clicking on the corresponding header. You can also mix and match selections by selecting the appropriate area of a row.

For convenience, total selected count is shown inside each respective column header.
